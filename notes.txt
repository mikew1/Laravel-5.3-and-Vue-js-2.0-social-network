Questions:

-- Aim: just read code here, compare styles with Ways' forum.

-- Qu:  How has Kati implemented the api for vue?
-- Ans: There isn't one!
        Vue here is just used as js wrapper to provide behaviour,
        and here, does not mean any ajax or spa.


-- See how easy it is to get confused due to multiple architectures.
   What a time sink.

-- Suggest measure time spent working on real needs of app,
   vs. exploring, then - 
   1) What is that proportion.  2) What should it be.


Note: have removed a generators (scaffold) package that has disappeared off of kati's github and was causing composer install to fail; since it was just a scaffold/generator command it probably won't matter being absent.
